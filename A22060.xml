            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But that which is moſt to be conſidered is, that amongſt them that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe fancies, and think they do well, there be as many differences of opinion, as there be different imaginations. For they haue no certaine rule of fayth, nor what to affirme, and therfore nothing is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and infallible amongſt them, as that they haue no certainty and conſtancy in that which they teach in the affirmatiue points of their profeſſion: for in the negatiue, all Sectaries agree to deny the Catholike truth.</p>

As for our children they are ſo well allyed, that there is no feare they can want, being of the yeares they are, &amp; all well conſidered they haue inough left them. But if notwithſtanding all theſe hopes ſhould fayle them; yet they liue vnder the protection of their heauenly Father, and vnder his prouidence, which is more to be eſteemed then all the treaſures of the world.</p>

            <p> As for my ſelfe, or any thing that may concerne me do not afflict your ſelfe in any caſe, for by Gods grace and fauour, I ſhal receaue more comfort in ſuffering pouerty with you, for ſo iuſt a cauſe, then in enioying all that we haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto poſſeſſed. Nay, fetting. aſide the obligation I haue to you and my children, I would chooſe to liue with leſſe then the Kings Maieſty muſt allow vs, ſuppoſing the moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous execution of his law: yea rather to looſe all, then you ſhould admit the leaſt diſquietnes, or ſtayn in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience.</p>
            <p>Conſider how little this world is to be eſteemed for it ſelfe, how vaine, vncertaine, and troubleſome it is, and that the greateſt part you haue enioyed of it hitherto, hath beene ſpent in ſatisfying your owne deſires, and the leaſt in his ſeruice that gaue you all you haue. You muſt alſo remember, that the goodes you poſſeſſe are but lent you: for the true Lord and owner is God himſelfe, who in a trice can take all from you, &amp; in ſuch ſort that they ſhall not auayle you, eyther for your body, or for your ſoule. Conſider then with your ſelfe his infinit goodnes in giuing you meanes to enioy an euerlaſting inheritance, onely for leauing willingly thoſe temporalities, wherof in very truth you are but a Steward. It is therfore great reaſon you be thankfull, and hould your ſelfe moſt happy to haue this occaſion, and to haue found that pretious Iewell, for which the wiſe Merchant ſould all that he had. By this meanes you ſhalbe partaker of that bleſſing, which by the ſupreme Iudge himſelfe is promiſed to ſuch as ſuffer perſecution for Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>And howſoeuer your Father may vrge and preſſe you, with the ouerthrowing of your houſe, and vndoing of your poſteritie; you muſt remember allwayes, that the obedience we owe to God, muſt haue the firſt place, and that without this all other vertues looſe their value, and be vnprofitable.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20618:15"/> Here alſo the holy Prophets obſeruation maketh much to our purpoſe, who affirmeth out of his owne experience of many yeares, That he neuer had ſeene the iuſt man forſaken, nor his poſterity come to want. And our Sauiour ſayth. He that for my ſake doth not leaue his Father, Mother, Wyfe, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and whatſoeuer els he hath, is not worthy of me. Wheras on the other ſide, he promiſeth to ſuch as forſake all for his loue, an hundred for one in this world, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eternall lyfe.</p>
            <p>Let vs therfore ſettle our ſelues in this truth, and eſtabliſh this good purpoſe in our hartes, not to admit for temporall reſpectes, any thing againſt our conſcience, which at the dreadfull day of doome muſt iudge vs. And what would it atravle vs to gaine the whole world, with loſſe of our ſoules for euer?</p>
            <p>It is not ſufficient for our ſaluation, to beleeue with the hart the truth which is taught vs, if we do not make publick profeſſion of it before all the world, when occaſion requireth. Not that we ought to hazard our ſelues without iuſt cauſe, for without it we may not offer our ſelues to daunger. And therfore if you feare to be vrged with the Oath, I thinke it better that you procure ſome Protection from the King to preuent your aduerſaries, then to be conſtrained to refuſe it in publicke iudgment: and this fauour you may procure by frendſhip, and ſo free your ſelf from his Maieſties diſpleaſure. But if in caſe it ſhould be thought more for Gods glorie, to refuſe it publickly in open Seſſions, (I ſpeake plainly my mind) I doe wholy ſubmit my ſelf to Gods good pleaſure, and my iudgment to yours, and to others that know better what is beſt to be done.</p>
            <p>Neyther doe I thinke it conuenient, that you depart the Realme without licence, leaſt by your abſence your enemies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20618:16"/> take occaſion to accuſe you of contempt to his Maieſty and his lawes, &amp; therupon proceed to all the rigour, which their malice can deuiſe againſt your Religion. For this, as you ſee, would be of little edification to others, and great loſſe of reputation to your ſelf, and of that merit, which you might gaine with God, taking the other courſe.</p>
            <p>Wherfore (my deare Huſband) I humbly beſeech you, diſpoſe your ſelfe to imbrace the very worſt that can befall you in this occaſion, and offer it all with a cheerfull hart, to our Sauiour, who loueth the ioyfull giuer. And aſſure your ſelf, that you haue nothing to feare for me, for I haue ſet vp my reſt, and am readie for all that God ſhall appoint. And if it proue affliction, I doubt not, but by his aſſiſtance it ſhall turne to ioy and contentment; conſidering for whome, and for what cauſe it is ſuffered.</p>
            <p>That which I deſire greatly is, that you conſider your debtes. For indeed if all we haue were our owne, let it all goe in Gods name for his loue, but we muſt not leeſe willingly that which is not ours. And therfore I haue ſent you an eſtimate, ſo neere as I can remember, of your preſent eſtate. And if it be your pleaſure, I will find meanes to come and ſee you: but for this purpoſe prouide me ſome houſe, whither I may retyre my ſelfe ſecurely. And with this I haue fulfilled your deſire, acquainting you with my opinion, peraduenture with more wordes then are neceſſary, of purpoſe to aſſure you, that you need take no care for me, nor for any thing that may concerne me: nor afflict your ſelfe with any feare of any trouble, loſſe, or perſecution that may befall you for the loue of God. All the reſt I commit to his diuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, beſeeching him to ſuccour and aſſiſt vs both with his grace and fauour. Amen.</p>

               <hi>and merry,</hi> that ſhe encouraged al that were about her, eſpecially at the tyme of her death, wherat was preſent the perſon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20618:22"/> that gaue this Relation, with another venerable Prieſt, afterwardes a Martyr, from whome I receaued as much as here I haue ſet downe, and diuers other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularityes which be not in the Story.</p>
            <p>One about the reſt is memorable, and very fit for our purpoſe in this place, that Catholickes may learne to abhorre all vnlawful communication with Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes and Heretickes, as the Apoſtles, &amp; diſciples of Chriſt, &amp; their ſucceſſors in the Primitiue Church haue taught vs by many examples, and is the very caſe, and the onely cauſe, why the Catholickes whome they call Recuſantes, ſuffer ſo grieuous perſecution, at this preſent, in England.</p>
            <p>This vertuous and deuout Gentle-woman, perceauing her ſelfe to draw neare to her end, and happy paſſage to a better life, amongſt many other matters of edification, and comfort to them that were about her, and her friendes then preſent, recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded one thing vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with eſpeciall charge, that her body might in no caſe be buryed, where any profane ſeruice or ſermons of Heretickes were to be vſed, for ſhe deſired to continue after her death as ſhe had lyued, though to her coſt, free from all communication with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And God almighty was pleaſed to do her the fauour, &amp; to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh her deſire.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20618:22"/> For although it could not be excuſed, to carry her body to the pariſh Church, with the ſolemnity accuſtomed, yet mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s was wrought, that no Miniſter was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor to be found at her buryall. And ſo hauing performed ſecretly the rites of the Catholicke Church before the body was brought out, it was buryed without any ſeruice or Ceremony of Proteſtantes. And the night following, before there could be any Seruice (as they call it) in the Church where it was buryed, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall perſon for his deuotion, found meanes to effect it, and with his owne handes opened the graue, &amp; accompanied with two truſtie ſeruantes, tooke out the Coffin with the body, and put it in holy ground in a more decent place, where no hereticall ſeruice is vſed, and where it is kept tyll this preſent day. And in this ſort God was pleaſed to accompliſh the pious deſire of this holy woman deceaſed, as he doth many tymes, fulfill the like deſires of his friendes, lyuing and dead, for the comfort and inſtruction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>And by the meaſure of theſe two Gentlewomen, &amp; of their fidelity, zeale, and conſtancie in Gods cauſe &amp; ſeruice, I frame a conceipt of all the reſt, that in England, or elſwhere ſuffer for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Religion. They be the true and

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:20618:39"/> ſcum, and refuſe of the Common wealth: ſuch as their bad life and miſdemeanour hath brought into neceſſity; ſuch as weary of robbing by the high waies, and other infamous occupations, take it for a more ſecure and eaſy kynd of lyfe, and moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their former courſes, and bringing vp, to become Biſhops Purſeuantes, and ſo offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to that miniſtery, before they be called. By all which his Maieſtyes moſt honorable Counſell, and all other men may eaſily vnderſtand, how exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant the wronges are, that by vertue of theſe Lawes are offered to the ſubiectes, being executed by ſuch Miniſters, armed with publicke Authority, and the Kinges Warrant, to commyt, without the feare of puniſhment (which before did keep them in awe) whatſoeuer inſolencie and iniuſtice they liſt.</p>
            <p>They vſe ordinarily to beſet the Catholikes houſes (eſpecially where they hope to find a booty) and ſcaling the walles by night, and breaking open the dores in the darke, to the amazement of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milyes, make that ſpoile and hauocke, which ſuch manner of people are like to do in ſuch occaſions.</p>
            <p>To the baſenes of the perſons, and rigour of the Lawes, may be added another thing worth the noting, to wit, the extorſion of the penalties by a new ſtratageme of Aſtronomy and computation of tymes of their owne. For example, the law is, <hi>That euery Recuſant pay twenty poundes a Moneth, for not going to Church.</hi> What doe theſe ingenuous Executours? The ordinary acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt that the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers gather by the motion of the Planets, doth not content them: by this the yeare, as weſe, is deuided into twelue Monethes: but it is not for them; they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20618:39"/> will haue it by weekes, and ſo find thirteene Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths in the yeare: &amp; by this accompt extend the penalty of that Statute vpon the Recuſants. Now what reaſon, equity, and iuſtice is in this, let any indifferent man conſider. The Lawes of themſelues are rigorous and odious, and theſe ſet them on the tenters, ſtretch them out beyond their nature, and execute them with more rigour, then the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers did intend: <hi>Viderit vtilitas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this example you may gather many others, which for breuity I omit. Heere ſomebody may doubt, ſeeing the Indignation of the Perſecutors of this time is greater, or at leaſt equall to that of Queene <hi>Elizabethes</hi> tyme; how commeth it to paſſe, that now there is not ſo much bloud ſhed, &amp; Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Prieſtes, and of their receauers as then? To this I anſwere; that experience hath taught them, how much they looſe by open cruelty. And they find it more for their aduauntage, to conſume the Catholikes by hunger, rather then to kyll them by the ſword. For making them awaie by little and little, they dy many deathes; the manner of their dying is more painfull, and leſſe ſpoken of; ſo that by this deuice they double their cruelty, &amp; yet haue a colour to pretend Clemencie and commendation of Mercy. Nay, that which is more, they would make the world belieue, they perſecute no man for Religion.</p>
            <p>And for this cauſe, hauing perſuaded his Royall Maieſty to follow the footſteps, &amp; renew the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of his Predeceſſour, they deuiſed this new Oath againſt the Popes Authority, to reduce (at leaſt in outward appearance) to matter of State &amp;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20618:40"/> Treaſon, that which is meerly a point of Catholike doctrine. And with this colour they begin a freſh to martyr Prieſts, ſeeing other puniſhments will not make them afrayd, and ſpoile Lay-Catholikes more then euer: and yet, forſooth, they perſecute no man for Religion. I wot not whence it commeth, (whether from the great opinion that they haue of their witts, or the little of ours) that they perſuade themſelues, that they ſhalbe belieued, when their wordes are ſo contrary to their doinges.</p>
            <p>In the fore ſaid Lawes, as they are extended in Engliſh, they forbid ſo often, and ſo largely the thinges pertayning to Religion, as they repeate two hundreth and ſeauenty tymes, the Name of <hi>Prieſts, Altars, Maſſes, Seminaries, Ieſuits, Colledges, Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, Faith, Sea Apoſtolicke, Biſhop of Rome, Head of the Church, Images, Churches, Agnus Dei, Madals, and Graines hallowed, Beades, Breuiaryes, Maſſe-bookes, Life of Saints,</hi> and the like: and for euery one of theſe Markes and Tokens of Catholicke Religion, they put a penalty, and many of them they forbid vnder paine of death. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that with theſe Lawes and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, they publiſh openly to the whole world their hatred againſt Catholicke Religion: yet they bluſh not on the other ſide to affirme, &amp; will needes be belieued, that they, forſooth, as I haue ſaid, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute no man for Religion, but all is for Treaſon and Practiſes againſt the State.</p>
            <p>I deſire the Reader heere to iudge, whether the things mentioned, or vſe of them, be crimes againſt the State, or that the State be well erected, where theſe actes of Piety and Religion are puniſhed as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20618:40"/> Crimes. To be ſhort: All theſe Treaſons and Crimes imputed to Catholickes, are comprized in one, to wit, to be faythfull ſeruantes of Chriſt, and obedient children of his Church. This is the Crime of Crimes, and Treaſon of Treaſons: this is the offence vnder ſo many, and ſo different names &amp; titles condemned, and puniſhed by theſe Lawes. This, in fine, is the ground, ſumme, and ſubſtance of this Perſecution, proſecuted ſo many yeares, and now renewed and increaſed, as here may be ſeene.</p>
            <p>There was ſome few yeares paſt a Conſpiracie of ſeauen or eyght yonge gentlemen, who induced (as the report goeth) by a traine of ſome chiefe Proteſtantes, intended with one fire to extinguiſh another, which had endured many yeares, deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and conſuming the bowells, and beſt ſubſtance of their Countrey. But howſoeuer it was begun and intended, let it be as their greateſt Aduerſaries will haue it (notwithſtanding the publike voyce, and many preſumptions prooue, that it was an Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of State, and a meere trap to entangle them:) Let vs, I ſay, graunt, that the ſame men, that put it in execution, were they, that layd the plot, &amp; were the Authors: Let vs graunt all this, and what elſe they can deſire: yet with what conſcience, and with what reaſon, ſhould any be made partaker of the danger or puniſhment, that had no part in the Action? that neyther gaue any conſent, or had any notice of what was intended? For if we admit this courſe of Iuſtice and this manner of proceding: if the fault of one, or of a few may be extended to a whole community, perforce all Comon-wealths muſt goe to wracke: yea mankind muſt periſh, all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20618:41"/> the whole world muſt downe at a blow. For by this Law, &amp; manner of gouernment they cannot ſtand. The Law of God and his diuine iuſtice hath a far different proceeding: for it ſaith expreſſly that he onely that commytteth the fault ſhalbe puniſhed, <hi>Iuſtitia iuſti ſuper eum erit, &amp; impietas impij erit ſuper eum:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 2.</note> 
               <hi>anima quae peccauerit, ipſa morietur.</hi> Why then ſhould that which was vndertaken by indiſcreet zeale and want of Conſideration in one or two, be imputed to the Religion, or to the reſt that doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, without any participation of the Crime?</p>
            <p>The Catholicke Church hath moſt holy and iuſt lawes, and ſuch as doe ſwarue from them, do in ſuch ſort periſh, that ſhe neuertheleſſe remayneth blameleſſe. For why, ſhe neyther doth, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth, nor approueth any euill. The faultes be perſonall and of priuate men; the doctrine is vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall which admitteth no faultes; theſe belonged to ſome few, and paſſe with tyme; the other is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and the cauſe common to all that be preſent and to come. And therfore we publiſh theſe Lawes to the ſight of the whole world: we anſwer &amp; print theſe Proclamations in diuers tongues, becauſe the notice of this caſe belongeth to all the Catholicke Church, which as one body, though diſperſed in diuers Countries, muſt needs feele the iniuſtice and violence offered to ſo principall a part, and pray for the remedy.</p>

            <p>Let no man flatter and deceaue himſelfe, nor be deceaued with vaine opinions. There is but one God, and one Truth, and one way to heauen, by true fayth, true hope, and true Charitie: for all muſt be gounded in truth, which can be but one. One heauen will not hould Queene <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> as their Religions, their Liues, and their Deathes were contrary, ſo infallibly be the places of their eternall aboad. His Maieſty hath relation to both; and yet it is in his hand and choyce, by Gods grace, which of them he will follow.</p>
            <p>And if togeather with the ſaluation of his ſoule,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20618:52"/> he will eſtabliſh alſo his Royall Eſtate vpon earth to himſelfe and his Poſterity; were it not a thouſand tymes better for him, to lay his foundation, and build vpon the ſetled Religion and rightfull deſcent from King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. &amp; from other his renowned Catholicke Aunceſtors, then vpon the ruines of Schiſme and Hereſie, brought in by the diſſolution of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. and continued with ſo many violences and deceiptes, as were vſed with ſome colour of Iuſtice in Queene <hi>Elizabethes</hi> daies, to hold her vp, and her broken Title on foot? If he follow her and her Father, he caſteth himſelfe and his into a world of ineuitable and endleſſe inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences: wheras if he prudently reiect the vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian deuiſes, inuented to giue Authority to their errors, and ſinnes, wholy impertinent to his right; and repayre for his Title to the roote, and take his Religion from whence his right muſt come: if he will haue it without controuerſy, he may with a wet finger put remedie to all. The End is Excellent, and the Meanes are Eaſie: he hath Examples in other Kingdomes, and what would he haue more?</p>
            <p>The Sect of the Proteſtantes in <hi>England,</hi> is a motly of many colours, a maſſe of many metalls, and iuſt the <hi>Statua</hi> of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> of gould, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and braſſe, borrowed of others, and with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then feet, which are onely their owne, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually decay.</p>
            <p>He that will make a durable building, muſt lay a ſure foundation, and rayſe his worke by leuell, otherwiſe though it may make a fayre ſhew for a while: yet certaine it is, the higher that it riſeth, the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20618:53"/> nearer it is to ruine. And hence commeth the fall of Princes, the decay of Common wealthes, and the change of earthly Monarches, from one lynage or people to another, becauſe they were not well foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or not well continued.</p>
            <p>There cannot poſſibly be deuiſed any other Religion ſo fit for Kinges (I meane ſuch as wilbe Kinges, and not Tyrantes) nor ſo profitable to Common wealths, as is the Chriſtian Catholicke Religion, giuen by Chriſt Ieſus, for the benefit of men; for by inward ſweet motions, and force, it reſtrayneth all exceſſes in thoſe that gouerne, and in thoſe that are gouerned, it worketh obedience and ſubiection, for Iuſtice and Conſcience ſake, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth them in loue and loyalty by the ſecret inſtincts of Reaſon and Grace, when other inferiour reſpects ſhould be wanting.</p>
            <p>Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that God Almighty hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the holy Lawes and Decrees of his Religion for the eternall ſaluation of Mankynd; yet, for that one good principle alwayes helpeth another: in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the ſame Religion is ſo commodious and fit, for the preſeruation of ſecular Eſtates, as if it had beene ordayned for nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>And it is iuſt as the ſinews in a mans body, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the bones and other ſolid partes are tyed togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch ſort, that although in the politicke go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment there may be errours and faultes: yet where this Religion floriſheth, and is kept in due reuerence, it ſupplyeth all other wants, &amp; houldeth togeather the parts of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-Wealth, not only in ordinary ſickneſſes, but in perilous diſeaſes: and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20618:53"/> keepeth it from death ruyne, and decay, when all other remedies haue loſt their force. And for this reaſon the proſperity of ſuch Kinges &amp; Kingdomes, as haue care to preſerue the purity and ſincerity of this Religion, are ſecure and durable, becauſe it reduceth all Eſtates to the groundes of Truth and Iuſtice, which only are permanent. And for the ſame reaſon ſuch as profeſſe other Sectes, muſt of force lyue in continuall diſquietnes, and ſtagger with daily feare, and ſuſpition, becauſe the pillars of their Security may faile them, and fall by many accidents.</p>
            <p>If with this new Oath, and Obligation to goe to the Proteſtants Churches, and other outward proteſtations, wherto his Maieſty intendeth to bynd his Subiectes, they became Proteſtants indeed, and left to be Catholickes in their harts; it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe (though on his part not well done for the thinges in themſelues be vnlawfull:) but ſeeing it falleth out cleane contrary, and ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this nor any other good is gotten by them, the longer they be vſed, &amp; the further they goe forward, the more his Maieſty looſeth by them. For they muſt needes cauſe in the parties iniured, and in their friends and well-willers hart-burning, againſt the Authors of ſuch violent proceeding, and leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and good will to his Maieſty euery day, contrary, as I ſuppoſe, to the ſecurity he intendeth, and to all that, in prudence he ſhould procure.</p>
            <p>Such as ſtand at his elbow, and <hi>ſet him</hi> (<note n="(K)" place="margin">Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes Conſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arij Pharaonis conſiliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt inſipiens. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 11.</note>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20618:54"/> and not his. <hi>Quaerunt quae ſua ſunt, non quae Regis, aut Chriſti.</hi> They are diligent, vigilant, and effectuall in all, that may bring them profit, but it is not the Kinges, as preſently ſhalbe ſeene. In other thinges they are prudent, but in this they are ſhort. Heere paſſion blyndeth, the matter is miſtaken, and then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needes fayle in the meanes. For the cauſe which they would maintaine being in it ſelfe vniuſt, they can bynd no mans conſcience by any violence to approue it (how ſoeuer ſome may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble for flatterie or feare) which auayleth litle to the Kinges purpoſe. Wherfore till they can finde out ſome proportionable meanes, to perſwade men of iudgment, that they haue Iuſtice on their ſide, and that their opinions are true, and the Catholicke Religion falſe, which (as they well know is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) all the reſt they can do to make their cauſe ſeeme good, is wholy vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>And togeather with this, ſuppoſing that which is moſt true (although ſuch as be about his Maieſty endeauour to conceale it) that the number of ſuch as be in their hartes Catholickes, and belieue all that the Recuſants profeſſe, is greater without all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, then theſe that be formally hereticks: and that euen amongſt thoſe that were furtheſt out of the way, many come euery day to vnderſtand the Truth, and many to profeſſe it: It were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and far more proportionable for that which his Maieſty intendeth (if he intend to quiet his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and aſſure his Royall Eſtate to himſelf, and his Succeſſors, when he ſhould be pleaſed to do no more) at leaſt to ſuffer mens conſciences to be free
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20618:54"/> (ſeing for the reaſon alleaged, he cannot tye them) and by this meanes content all, and oblige all to loue him, and ſerue him, and eſpecially thoſe that now he houldeth in greateſt iealouſy, to be his moſt loyall Subiectes, and moſt obedyent and more ſure to him, then any of the reſt: then contrary wiſe vſing violence, without neceſſity, where it can haue no place, whilſt he laboureth to content a few, cauſe iuſt indignation in multitudes, which can bring no good, and in tyme may be occaſion of many ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table harmes.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, for the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which his Maieſty hath to vnite his two Kingdomes of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> in one, vnder the Title of Great Bryttaine, what meane can be deuiſed more effectuall, then that which onely hath vnity in it ſelfe, and conſequently vertue to vnite others, and which only hath meanes to preſerue it ſelfe, and ſuch as imbrace it in vnity? The Catholicke fayth hath this propriety to vnite, and with her ſecret vertue, and force to reduce ſuch as lyue diſperſed like ſauage and wilde people, to the eſtate of men, and perfect vſe of reaſon, in ciuill lyfe, teaching them to brydle their paſſions, and conquer their ill cuſtomes, &amp; amend their manners, and abandone their former vices and ſinnes: and in ſine, to yield their willes to rule and reaſon, making them men, and Chriſtian men, faythfull to God and dutyfull to their Commaunders, which before were barbarous, rebellious to God and to their Princes, and litle better then beaſtes.</p>
            <p>This the ancient, Hiſtories that treate of the peopling of many partes of <hi>Europe,</hi> doe teach moſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20618:55"/> euidently, where men lyued like bruyte beaſtes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were inſtructed, and reformed with this holy Religion. And at this day we ſee, in <hi>Braſile,</hi> and many partes of the <hi>Indies,</hi> that Catholicke Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath effected with great facility, that which ſouldyers &amp; Armes could not do, drawing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of the caues, mountaynes and woods, which before they inhabited euery one by himſelfe, to build townes and Cytties in the playnes, and lyue ſociably in Community, frequenting the Churches and holy Sacramentes, and all other actes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion, with great piety and deuotion. And both the Hiſtories of theſe Countryes, and ſuch as come from thence teſtifie, that with this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſcipline they haue profited ſo much in ciuility, morall conuerſation, and politike lyfe, that in many places they are nothing inferiour to the ancient Chriſtians, yea in ſome parts they goe beyond them, in the exerciſes of Chriſtianity, and in all that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable in a morall lyfe: in ſo much as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of theſe Countries laying downe their armes, &amp; giuing ouer attempts of war many tymes vſed with much bloudſhed, and little effect, haue thought it a better courſe, &amp; more proportionable to their end, to ſend them teachers to inſtruct them in the Catholicke fayth, becauſe they ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that with this meane they bring to paſſe eaſily in few monethes, that which they could not do by force in many yeares.</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſayd of ſome Nations here in <hi>Europe,</hi> which haue profeſſed enimity and deadly hatred, tyme out of mynd, one againſt another,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20618:55"/> by reaſon of bloudy warres and hoſtility, that had paſſed betweene them, and by meanes of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne band of vnity, haue beene reconciled, and brought to lyue vnder one Gouerment, with great peace and friendſhip, which doubtleſſe could neuer haue beene done, nor ſo inueterate and violent humors tempered, but by this ſacred and ſweete lenitiue of Catholicke Religion. And for this reaſon it is called Catholicke; becauſe as it is common to all, ſo it is fit for all, and a common band with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar effect, to reunyte and tie togeather ſuch, as the waywardnes of mans miſerable nature, hath drawne to auerſion and deuided.</p>
            <p>Extremes, if they are to be made, one muſt needs haue ſome meanes to vnite them, and thoſe which agree in one third, and ſo principall a meane of vnion, as is the Catholike faith, with hope &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in ſuch a body of Religion, as agreeth in thoſe vertues, may eaſily preſerue themſelues in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and accord, though in ſome leſſer matters there ariſe differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. Will you haue a proofe of this neare home, and proper to this purpoſe? I my ſelfe in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers partes haue knowne Engliſh-men and Scottes (notwithſtanding their old auerſion and antipathy, almoſt turned into nature, yet being Catholikes) to liue togeather in great amity and friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Neither muſt it ſeeme ſtrange: for the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in the ſame faith, the common vſe of the ſame Sacraments, and common fountaine of grace, piercing and deuiding betwixt the marrow and the bone, doth clenſe the ruſt &amp; canker of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inſtinct, and remoue all Nationall quarrels &amp;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20618:56"/> emulations. And without doubt, neyther can his Maieſty find, nor any other man deuiſe, any other ſo proportionable a meane as this, to make his two Kingdomes one, or to preſerue any long time the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity begun betweene them: conſidering the deadly hatred, faſtered and inueterated cauſes of diſunion, which they haue carried in their bowels for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages paſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Non adhaeret teſta ferro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Nature cannot do it, nor Art bring it to paſſe. Onely this heauenly confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is able to worke this great wonder. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more in particuler may be, becauſe this Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, once entring and taking root in mens harts, it is as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Virtus Dei ad ſalutem,</hi> ſubduing in man, whatſoeuer is of man, to the obedience of our Sauiour God, and Man Chriſt Ieſus, whereby man ceaſeth to be himſelfe, and that which before he was to himſelfe, and is transformed into a liuely member, and part of the Myſticall body of Chriſt, &amp; for reuerence and due reſpect to his Head, yieldeth dutifull obedience to all lawfull Superiours, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſpirituall or temporall, to ech of them in that which appertayneth to their charge, as to the Subſtitutes &amp; Lieftenants of him, to whom all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is due. And as this is voluntary proceeding of conſcience and loue: ſo it cauſeth concord and good will to all others of the ſame body, without difference, many times to ſuch, as for perſonall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects deſerue little to be obeyed or loued.</p>
            <p>This is the true root and reaſon of eſtate: this is the true and only policie, to effect vnion: this is the only proper method of curing old inueterate ſoares
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20618:56"/> of diſcord; and the only way to heale effectually, thoſe that ſo long time haue layen feſtering. And howſoeuer at this preſent they be couered, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-healed, they be not hoale in the bottome, and therefore muſt be prudently, and perfectly healed, leaſt with new occaſions they breake out againe, with greater violence and extremity then euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>And to haſten this breach, I cannot imagine how his Maieſty, or any for him, could deuiſe a more effectuall or more ſpeedy meanes, then he hath taken in hand, powling and impoueriſhing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Engliſhmen Catholikes, to enrich and adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſtrangers and heretikes, to whome he giueth their goods, and diſpoſſeſſeth them of their Patrimonyes, and Lands, which their Anceſtors had lawfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed many hundred yeares, only becauſe they will not ſweare that which they thinke to be falſe, nor goe, againſt their Conſciences, to the Proteſtants Churches, without any other offence to the King, or Common-wealth. Who can looke on this, be he neuer ſo great an enemy of Catholike Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that will not loath it, eſpecially conſidering that thoſe who ſuffer theſe wrongs, are the beſt Subiects, moſt innocent, and of more vertuous and exemplary life, then any other of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe they were deceaued in their beliefe, houlding for true the Religion, which all their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, euen from the Apoſtles time haue belieued: for their aduerſaries cannot giue inſtance, where, when, or by whome, any poynt of that which they belieue and profeſſe, was inuented, or brought in,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20618:57"/> ſince the Apoſtles tyme, notwithſtanding their cauill of Ceremonyes, and other accidents out of the ſubſtance, which may be added, altered, or taken away, as tymes and oceaſions require, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice to the fayth or Religion, to which they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. But, as I ſay, ſuppoſing the Catholicks liued in errour and misbeliefe, this ſame errour authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by ſo long Preſcription (as I haue ſayd) deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not puniſhment, but pardon and toleration; eſpecially it being, as their greateſt enemies muſt needes confeſſe, without any hurt to the Common wealth: for none can deny, but that the Recuſants lyfe and conuerſation is of much more edification and good example, in all manner of Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, then any of the reſt.</p>
            <p>And this, and no other thing is the cauſe, that their Aduerſaryes finding in them no faults of their owne, are forced to accuſe them of other mens of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and to calumniate and ſlaunder them, with falſe imputations (as the old Perſecutors did the Chriſtians of the primitiue Church:) and this alſo is the cauſe of ſo vnuſuall and improper manner of ſpeaking, as may be obſerued in theſe Proclamations and Lawes. And they are drawne by neceſſity to this manner of proceeding, &amp; forced to charge them with ſecret crimes, for indeed all that paſſeth in publicke, wherof the world may be wytnes, is in their fauour. And therfore they vrge them, what they thinke, and not onely that, but what they would thinke in tyme to come, vpon conditionall caſes, which are neuer like to be. A ſtrange manner of proceeding, and not heard of in other places.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20618:57"/> But to this miſerable perplexity and ſuſpition men come, that will gouerne without God, &amp; his Truth.</p>
            <p>And if theſe thinges of themſelues cannot but mooue to compaſſion any true Engliſh indifferent hart, of whatſoeuer Religion the party be; what an ey-ſore muſt it needes be, &amp; what hart-burning, thinke you, doth it cauſe, to ſee withall the ſpoyle of theſe innocent ſubiects, turned to mayntaine the pride and ſuperfluities of Strangers: ſome of them making their neſtes in the toppes of the Nobleſt, and fruitfulleſt trees, that is, planting themſelues in the beſt Houſes and Familyes, and occupying the chiefeſt Offices and Roomes of the Common wealth: &amp; others returning home to their Countrey loaden with the ſpoile of Catholickes goodes, who doubtleſſe leaſt of all others, feele their owne harms, as men beſt armed with patience, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with the conſiderations aboueſayd, and the like, to ſuffer all that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But for the reſt, no doubt, but their hartes are filled with indignation, and bytternes, whatſoeuer Religion they profeſſe, and much more thoſe of other Sectes, and moſt of all thoſe that be furtheſt of from Catholicke Recuſancie, as men leſſe mortified, more ſtyrring, &amp; more ready to be moued to anger, diſdayne and reuenge, howſoeuer they may couer it for a tyme. And this generally out of Nationall paſſions, and affections, which no doubt are more vehement, and more inflamed, where there concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alſo particuler reſpectes. And at this day you ſhall hardly find any one famylie of worth in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> that by one way or other, in the roote, or in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20618:58"/> the branches, hath not allyance, or intereſt in the cauſe perſecuted.</p>
            <p>The experience of fourty yeares, and vpward, wherin they haue perſecuted the Catholickes in that Kingdome, ſuppoſing by that way to roote out their Religion, is a ſtrong argument amongſt many others, to conuince their Aduerſaries, that they hould a wrong courſe: for all the world ſeeth, that by this perſecution Catholicks haue increaſed, both in number and zeale, &amp; with them, the meanes that God hath ordained for their preſeruation, both at home &amp; abroad. For within the Kingdome there be at this day many more Prieſtes and Religious men, to teach the Truth to ſuch as deſire it, then were when Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made the firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall Lawes againſt them. And generally Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes are more conſtant, and more ready to endure the penalty of the Lawes, and the Colledges for the bringing vp of ſuch, as God ſelecteth for the mayntenance of this cauſe, are more in number euery day. And as their afflictions continue, ſo their friends increaſe, and the more their vertue is tryed, and their cauſe more knowne, the more readines they find, and more deſire in all good men to help them.</p>
            <p>This experience in truth, were there nothing elſe, doth plainly demonſtrate, that his Maieſty in prudence of Eſtate (though he had no greater Motyues) ſhould bethinke himſelfe of ſome other courſe, and vſe more proportionable meanes, to bring about his Honourable Deſignments.</p>
            <p>And doubtleſſe if his Iudgment and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20618:58"/> Giftes be anſwerable to the report, he will eaſily ſee the conuenience, by that which hath beene ſayd, ſetting paſſion and bad Counſayle aſide. For what man is there of any vnderſtanding, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene troubled fourty yeares togeather, with one and the ſelfe ſame infirmity, and vſing all that while the ſame dyet, the ſame Phiſitians, the ſame method in curing, &amp; the ſelfe ſame medicines, and yet with all this tyme, trouble, and coſt, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelf no whit the better, but euery day worſe: Who I ſay (if he be in his wits) will not take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile with other Phiſitians, and at the leaſt make try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of that which they preſcribe, for the recouery of his health.</p>
            <p>If therfore his Gracious Maieſty deſire to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to theſe Honourable ends, to wit, the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his Kingdome, and the ſecurity of his Royall Perſon, and Poſterity, togeather with their Aduancement, &amp; increaſe of Reputation &amp; Eſtate, he will paſſe no further in theſe blind by wayes of his vnfortunate Kinſwoman (if I may ſo call her) and Predeceſſour. For though there were no other inconuenience in them: yet this one may ſuffice to a generous Spirit, not to be inforced to ſeeke frienſhip with Infidels, nor depend vpon the Rebels of other Princes as ſhe did, and other things very ill beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo renowned a Nation, and the Perſon of a Chriſtian Queene.

They mention likwiſe a memorable caſe, wherin is diſcouered Gods great mercy with ſinners, and his care and prouidence ouer his choſen, many times when they leaſt thinke of it, and haue moſt need. <note place="margin">(F) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <head>The Letter ſayth thus.</head>
               <p>ONE of the Lawes of this Parlament is, that the New Oath be tendred to all of eyghtene yeares and vpward, vnleſſe they be Barons. A new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance to no other purpoſe, but to make more odious thoſe which without neceſſity make ſuch lawes, &amp; to confirme our experience, that ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be alwaies accompanied with ſuſpitions and feares; beſides the forcing of men to periury. For I do not ſee, but that when any man ſweareth againſt his conſcience, though it be true, he incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth periury. Neither do I ſee, what it can auayle the Kings Maieſty, if all his Kingdome ſweare what he pleaſeth, if firſt he perſuade them not that it is truth which they ſweare. For he is neuer a whit the more ſecure, that all his people commit periury. Beſides the very obliging them in this manner to ſweare, maketh them leſſe true vnto him: for ſuſpition and iealouſy is the bane of friendſhip. And how can they loue him, of whoſe loue and fidelity he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelfe to doubt? For if he truſted them, he would not in all wiſdome and prudence, proceed in this rigorous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, ſo to burden their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by forcing them to periury. And this is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinion heere with vs. By vertue of this Law they haue put to death a Prieſt, called <hi>Cadwalledour,</hi> that in this manner refuſed the Oath. And for the ſame cauſe haue they condemned many others, both men &amp; women, to loſſe of their goods, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall impriſonment; caſting them into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20618:67"/> Iailes amongſt theeues &amp; malefactors, thinking therby to make breach in their Conſciences with this vexation.</p>
               <p>They haue likewiſe made a Law againſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who, as hath bene ſaid, had the priuiledge of women in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes. This Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, that ſuch as will not goe to Church, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate (with the Caluiniſts) be put in priſon, till their Husbands redeeme them, by paying ten pounds a moneth, or the third part of their goods. And it cannot be imagined, what confuſion this Law maketh in the whole Realme, where many Husbands be Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; their Wiues Catholicks.</p>
               <p>An other Prieſt they haue alſo condemned in <hi>Oxford</hi> for the ſame Oath; who liuing in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Iaile, it happened that there were two Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts malefactours chayned togeather, and one of them moued by the preſence of the Prieſt, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to informe himſelfe of the Catholicke Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but hindred by the two Lawes againſt <hi>Reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation</hi> and <hi>Perſuaſion,</hi> and with the chayne, ſo that he could not ſpeake to the Prieſt, but that his fellow muſt know it, nor ſeeke the others conſent without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Law. After much perplexity, and many conflicts, he reſolued to open himſelfe to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, as he did, and brought him likewiſe to deſire his ſaluation; and ſo came both togeather to the Prieſt, and being inſtructed, they renounced their hereſy, and reſolued to die in the Catholicke fayth.</p>
               <p>After they were condemned, as they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to execution, the Caluiniſt-Miniſters came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20618:68"/> them, offering to exhort them after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: but the priſoners caſt them of with contempt, and being asked the cauſe, anſwered, that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had brought them to the gallowes, and ſeing it could not help them to heauen, they had reſolued to die Catholiks: and if they had liued in the ſame Religion, wherin they deſired to die, they had neuer come to that infamous death: but ſeing things paſt could not be vndone, they moſt willingly accepted the puniſhment, which God had layd vpon them, with great confidence and aſſurance, that for the merits of our Sauiours paſſion and death, he would receaue theirs, and their harty repentance, in ſome recompence of their former ſinnes. And ſo died with great edification, and example to the people, verifying in <hi>England</hi> that which Chriſt ſayd to the Princes of the Iewes, <hi>Publicani &amp; Meretrices praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vos in Regno Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Caluiniſts or Proteſtants (call them as you liſt, for they be eyther) haue intrenched themſelues in this Iland, like ſo many mutined ſouldiars, that haue gotten a ſtrong Hold, and there they make Lawes at their pleaſure, diſguiſing their vnlawfull proceedings with honorable termes, and honeſt manner of ſpeach, and (as it ſeemeth) perſuade themſelues, that others muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. But it is impoſſible, that ſo euident a truth can be hid vnder their buſhell. The nature of truth challengeth her place in the view of the world, and for themſelues it moſt importeth, that truth be laied open and diſcouered, to the end that when all other reſpects ſhould faile, yet the iuſt feare of infamie
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20618:68"/> may moderate their exceſſes, or at leaſt keepe in others by their example; as the Poet ſayth:</p>

               <bibl>Horat. lib. 1. ſerm. 7.</bibl>
               <p>I haue alſo heard theſe dayes reported by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of credit lately come from <hi>Spayne,</hi> another caſe worthy to be knowne; for it confirmeth not a little that which hath beene ſayd; to wit, that the Catholicke fayth <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note n="(A)" place="margin">Sicut palma florebit</note> 
                  <hi>more it is trodden downe,</hi> the more it riſeth: the more it is cropt, the deeper roote it taketh, and the more it is oppreſſed with perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the more it ſpreadeth it ſelfe, and euery day gayneth more ground, and more opinion and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in all good mens minds, and is more loued and eſteemed of all.</p>
               <p>The report is alſo, that about the ſame time that in <hi>England</hi> they baniſhed by Proclamation all Prieſts and Religious men from <hi>London</hi> their Court; God Almighty inſpired <hi>a Stranger</hi> 
                  <note n="(B)" place="margin">Caeſar Bogaçio.</note> 
                  <hi>to call them,</hi> by his laſt Will and Teſtament, to the Court of <hi>Spayne,</hi> leauing them commodious dwelling, both for the ſituation, and capacity of the houſes, and all his goods, to make an Engliſh Colledge in <hi>Madrid,</hi> moued, as they ſay, by that which he had ſeene in the Seminarie of <hi>Valliadolid,</hi> as a neere Neighbour to it, when the Court was there. And two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances concurre in this action, worthy to be noted: one that he began this Colledge in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Court, the very ſame day, that his Maieſty of <hi>England</hi> had prefixed for the Prieſts to depart out
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20618:69"/> of his. The other, that the partie who gaue this gift, did it vnder condition, that no memory ſhould be made with men, of that which he did. But for the very ſame reaſon I haue taken this occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him. For honour of right belongeth only to them that flie it, and God Almighty vſeth to reward not onely in heauen, but in this world alſo works of vertue done purely for his ſake.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman was an <hi>Italian,</hi> borne in the Citty of <hi>Luca,</hi> although for his long continuance in the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> his ſeruice, he was accounted as one of that Countrie. And here likewiſe it is to be conſidered, that <hi>Antonius Bonuiſo,</hi> the Man that with his charity maintained the Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and Martyr <hi>Syr Thomas More,</hi> patterne of loialty in Kings Counſellours, and ſeruants, all the time that his Lord King <hi>Henry</hi> the eyght kept him priſoner in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe he would not conſent to his vnlawfull outrages, was of the ſame Citty of <hi>Luca.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Bonuiſo</hi> afterwards with great liberality intertayned in his houſe at <hi>Louayne</hi> the Prieſts and ſecular Catholikes that left <hi>England</hi> in the beginning of Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> perſecution.</p>
               <p>And if any man aſke me what correſpondence there is, or what occaſion of amity betwene <hi>England</hi> and the State of <hi>Luca,</hi> that from thence ſhould ariſe men ſo eminently well affected to Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in ſuch occaſions as theſe? There can be giuen no other cauſe (as I ſuppoſe) but the good pleaſure of Almighty God, that layd hand vpon <hi>Abacuc,</hi> and carried him from <hi>Iudaea</hi> by the haire of his head, to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:20618:69"/> feed his Prophet in the dungeon of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and choſe <hi>Zachaeus</hi> for his Hoſt in <hi>Iericho,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> &amp; his ſiſters in <hi>Bethania</hi> for his ordinary Inne, and would not do this fauour to any of the Scribes or Phariſies in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> nor to any other Inhabitant of that Citty. This is a priuiledge which our Sauiour granteth to whome he pleaſeth; and we can giue no other reaſon, why he doth it, but his holy will. Onely by experience we ſee, that he will not be ſerued of euery mans houſe, nor of euery mans perſon, or goods, in theſe like occaſions. In fine, he is Lord and Owner of all: <hi>Domini eſt terra &amp; plenitudo eius.</hi> And as the Princes of the earth do not ſerue themſelues indifferently of all, but of their beſt beloued, and moſt truſtie ſeruants, in things of their particuler liking: ſo it fareth with this great Lord of Lords. And as it is a fauour when he giueth any man meanes &amp; poſſibility to do good works: ſo is it a double, and farre greater fauour, to giue him withall, prudence, good occaſion, and deſire to do them, and to beſtow profitably that which God hath left to his diſpoſition. And amongſt all the imployments, that can be in this world of temporall goods, there is none ſo certayne, and of ſo great intereſt, as that which Chriſtians haue, vnder the gouerment of Infidels, that ſpoyle them, and make hauocke of their goods, becauſe they will not forſake their fayth, nor conſent to their errour. For theſe men (doubtleſſe) in lieu of the little which they can leeſe for God, receaue euen in this world the comforts and pledges of eternall ſaluation (wherof hath beene ſpoken
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20618:70"/> aboue) and ſoone after ſhall enter into his riches that haue no meaſure, and enioy the treaſure of euerlaſting felicity, and be made partakers of his Kingdome for euer.</p>
